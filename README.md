# Linear_Regression_with_One_Variable
Regression refers to a set of methods for modeling the relationship between data points x and corresponding real-valued targets y.  In the natural sciences and social sciences, the purpose of regression is most often to characterize the relationship between the inputs and outputs.  Machine learning, on the other hand, is most often concerned with prediction. Regression problems pop up whenever we want to predict a numerical value. Common examples include predicting prices (of homes, stocks, etc.), predicting length of stay (for patients in the hospital), demand forecasting (for retail sales), among countless others.
